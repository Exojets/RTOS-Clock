# RTOS Clock

## Video Demonstration

## Project Description
RTOS Clock is a digital clock program written in C++ using the Arduino IDE and ESP-IDF FreeRTOS, which is a variant of FreeRTOS that supports multicore programming. It is meant to be uploaded to an ESP32 Feather microcontroller, which then forms a circuit that includes physical controls for the clock, an LCD screen, a buzzer, and an LED light. 

I completed RTOS Clock as a personal programming project in order to gain an understanding of software development for real-time operating systems. In the process, I also learned about building electric circuits.
